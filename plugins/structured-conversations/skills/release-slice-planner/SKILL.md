# Release Slice Planner

Plan release slices from a completed user story map and write a reusable planning artifact.

## Find Inputs Before Asking

Before asking the user for inputs, check whether relevant material already exists:

1. Check if the user provided files, notes, or prior artifacts in this conversation
2. Look for related outputs from earlier skills in the workspace
3. Only ask for missing information that cannot be reasonably inferred

Required inputs:

- A completed `user-story-map` artifact.
## Structure The Plan

At minimum capture:

- the source story map
- release slice summaries
- risks and validation checks per slice
- assumptions and open questions about ordering or scope

Prefer evidence-backed slice language. Keep heuristics explicit when the source map does not yet contain enough planning detail.

## User Experience Contract

- Speak to the user in plain language centered on their goal, the concrete map, draft, plan, report, or scenario set being created, and the next useful step.
- Prefer the concrete deliverable name over generic system terms like artifact, canonical package, compatible output, or generator unless technical detail is necessary.
- When prerequisites are missing, frame the gap as "what I need from you" and explain the smallest useful next action.
- Locate the best existing project content for this skill before asking the user to paste, restate, or re-upload it.
- If more than one plausible draft, map, note set, or saved plan matches, present a short human-friendly choice based on title, topic, and recency.
- Keep the user on readable maps, drafts, plans, reports, and previews rather than backend manifests, indexes, or internal runtime files.
- After generation, explain what the user should review and suggest the most likely next step for the artifact.

## Write Outputs

Save the result to the user's workspace or selected folder. Produce:

1. A structured markdown document with the primary content
2. A single-file HTML page rendering the artifact in its board layout (zones, lanes, cards, or spatial groupings). Use clean semantic HTML with a light/dark-friendly palette.
3. Any supporting artifacts (diagrams, tables, summaries) as separate files if needed

Name files using kebab-case descriptive slugs (e.g., `checkout-flow-empathy-map.md`, `checkout-flow-empathy-map.html`).

## Quality Bar

- Output is complete and self-contained — a reader can act on it without additional context
- Evidence and sources are cited, not invented
- Open questions and assumptions are called out explicitly
- Structure follows the conventions for this artifact type
