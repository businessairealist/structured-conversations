# Feature Map Facilitator

Create a workshop-ready feature-map artifact with seeded prompts and open questions.

## Find Inputs Before Asking

Before asking the user for inputs, check whether relevant material already exists:

1. Check if the user provided files, notes, or prior artifacts in this conversation
2. Look for related outputs from earlier skills in the workspace
3. Only ask for missing information that cannot be reasonably inferred

## Use When

- the user is facilitating a feature discovery session
- the team needs a shared artifact that can evolve live
- the next step is likely acceptance criteria, example mapping, or rule clarification

## Inputs

- feature name
- optional actors, rules, examples, outcomes, steps, and questions
- optional source notes or artifact paths

## Process

1. start from the feature under discussion
2. pre-seed the board with facilitation prompts and open questions
3. organize contributions by lane so the discussion stays structured
4. emit a workshop artifact that can be refined later

## User Experience Contract

- Speak to the user in plain language centered on their goal, the concrete map, draft, plan, report, or scenario set being created, and the next useful step.
- Prefer the concrete deliverable name over generic system terms like artifact, canonical package, compatible output, or generator unless technical detail is necessary.
- When prerequisites are missing, frame the gap as "what I need from you" and explain the smallest useful next action.
- This skill is an explicit opt-in path. Do not use it as a silent fallback when a real artifact request is missing prerequisites.
- Locate the best existing project content for this skill before asking the user to paste, restate, or re-upload it.
- If more than one plausible draft, map, note set, or saved plan matches, present a short human-friendly choice based on title, topic, and recency.
- Keep the user on readable maps, drafts, plans, reports, and previews rather than backend manifests, indexes, or internal runtime files.
- After generation, explain what the user should review and suggest the most likely next step for the artifact.

## Write Outputs

Save the result to the user's workspace or selected folder. Produce:

1. A structured markdown document with the primary content
2. A single-file HTML page rendering the artifact in its board layout (zones, lanes, cards, or spatial groupings). Use clean semantic HTML with a light/dark-friendly palette.
3. Any supporting artifacts (diagrams, tables, summaries) as separate files if needed

Name files using kebab-case descriptive slugs (e.g., `checkout-flow-empathy-map.md`, `checkout-flow-empathy-map.html`).

## Quality Bar

- Output is complete and self-contained — a reader can act on it without additional context
- Evidence and sources are cited, not invented
- Open questions and assumptions are called out explicitly
- Structure follows the conventions for this artifact type
