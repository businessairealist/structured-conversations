# Story Map Template Generator

Generate a reusable classic user story map template with backbone activities, story prompts, and starter release slices.


Use this skill when a team wants a repeatable story-mapping canvas before the actual stories are fully known.

## Find Inputs Before Asking

Before asking the user for inputs, check whether relevant material already exists:

1. Check if the user provided files, notes, or prior artifacts in this conversation
2. Look for related outputs from earlier skills in the workspace
3. Only ask for missing information that cannot be reasonably inferred

Required inputs:

- one persona or actor
- one goal

Optional inputs:

- backbone activities
- whether to seed example stories
## Generate The Template

Use this sequence:

1. Define the persona and goal.
2. Create the backbone activities.
3. Add reusable story prompts under each activity.
4. Seed release slices as workshop planning prompts.

## Write Outputs

Save the result to the user's workspace or selected folder. Produce:

1. A structured markdown document with the primary content
2. A single-file HTML page rendering the artifact in its board layout (zones, lanes, cards, or spatial groupings). Use clean semantic HTML with a light/dark-friendly palette.
3. Any supporting artifacts (diagrams, tables, summaries) as separate files if needed

Name files using kebab-case descriptive slugs (e.g., `checkout-flow-empathy-map.md`, `checkout-flow-empathy-map.html`).

## User Experience Contract

- Speak to the user in plain language centered on their goal, the concrete map, draft, plan, report, or scenario set being created, and the next useful step.
- Prefer the concrete deliverable name over generic system terms like artifact, canonical package, compatible output, or generator unless technical detail is necessary.
- When prerequisites are missing, frame the gap as "what I need from you" and explain the smallest useful next action.
- This skill is an explicit opt-in path. Do not use it as a silent fallback when a real artifact request is missing prerequisites.
- Locate the best existing project content for this skill before asking the user to paste, restate, or re-upload it.
- If more than one plausible draft, map, note set, or saved plan matches, present a short human-friendly choice based on title, topic, and recency.
- Keep the user on readable maps, drafts, plans, reports, and previews rather than backend manifests, indexes, or internal runtime files.
- After generation, explain what the user should review and suggest the most likely next step for the artifact.
